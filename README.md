### Security / Authentication

As the webserver provides just basic auth for access you should combine some with eh a https for public server. Here s simple `proxy_pass` for nginx.

```
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/YOURHOST
server {
    server_name YOURHOST;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOURHOST/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOURHOST/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}

```

## Setting Up Telegram Bot

First, you'll need to create a bot for Telegram. Just talk to [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and follow simple steps until it gives you a token for it.
You'll also need to create a Telegram group, the place where you and crypto-trading-bot will communicate. After creating it, add the bot as administrator (make sure to uncheck "All Members Are Admins").

### Retrieving Chat IDs

Invite `@RawDataBot` to your group and get your group id in sended chat id field

```text

 ├ message_id: 338
 ├ from
 ┊  ├ id: *****
